# Color clustering

This code is a part of a larger project whose goal is to study the dimensionality of the human perception of colors. This repository contains the code to run an experiment which asks participants to assess the similarity between two colors for several trials. It also contains the code to embed the colors in an 2D space based on the reported trials from the participants.
